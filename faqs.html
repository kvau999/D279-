          <strong>Question:</strong> How long can I expect my dog to live based on their breed and size, and what can I do to help them live a healthier life?<br>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> The lifespan of a dog can vary greatly depending on their breed and size. For example, smaller breeds like Chihuahuas can live up to 15-20 years, whereas larger breeds like Great Danes typically live 7-10 years. To help your dog live a healthier life, provide them with a balanced diet, regular exercise, routine veterinary checkups, and plenty of love and mental stimulation.

Prevent fleas from returning by keeping your pet’s bedding clean, using flea preventatives regularly, and maintaining a clean home environment.

          <strong>Question:</strong> How often should I groom my cat to prevent hairballs, and are there any specific tools or products you recommend?<br>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Groom your cat at least once a week, or more frequently for long-haired breeds, to reduce shedding and prevent hairballs. Use a slicker brush or grooming gloves to remove loose fur gently. Specialized hairball control cat foods and treats can also help minimize hairball formation.
